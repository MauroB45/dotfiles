# Personal config

Here I keep and maintain my dotfiles and brew packages. This is my personal repository for my own personal osx setup!. It includes a lot of tools, aliases and custom functions for productivity boost.

Please feel free to use it. [recomendations](#recomendations)


# Installation

In order to bootstrap and create the symlink for the configuration files:

```sh
# run in terminal
sh bootstrap.exclude.sh
```


# Recomendations

If you are going to use this setup please make sure to backup all your dotfile files first. Comments have been added so you can customize it.
